## Overview
This project presents a multifaceted machine learning approach to analysing customer churn in a telecommunications company. The study was conducted as part of an MSc-level module on Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning using Python.

The objective is to demonstrate how different machine learning techniques—classification, regression, and clustering—can be applied to a real-world business problem to support data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**, which contains customer demographic information, service usage details, billing data, and a churn indicator.

**Target Variable:**
- `Churn` (Yes / No)

**Key Features:**
- Customer tenure
- Monthly charges
- Contract type
- Internet and phone services
- Payment method

## Methodology
The project follows a structured data science workflow:

1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Logistic Regression for churn classification  
4. Linear Regression for churn probability estimation  
5. K-Means clustering for customer segmentation  
6. Business interpretation of results  

---

## Models Used
- **Logistic Regression** – binary churn prediction  
- **Linear Regression** – continuous churn risk estimation  
- **K-Means Clustering** – customer segmentation  

Each model provides complementary insights into customer behaviour.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Results
The analysis shows that customer churn is strongly influenced by:
- Contract type
- Monthly charges
- Customer tenure  

Combining predictive models with clustering provides a more comprehensive understanding of churn drivers and supports targeted retention strategies.
